# Developing Apps using emerging Web Technologies

## Project Specifications
Your client needs an application to help nurse practitioners to monitor patients during the first weeks of their release from the hospital and also help the patients to monitor their daily activities. Develop a web app that implements the following functionalities:

1.	User registration/login

2.	If the user is a **nurse**:
- Allow the user to enter vital signs: *body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, or respiratory rate.*
- Allow the user to access information captured during a previous clinical visit, vital signs: *body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, or respiratory rate.*
- Allow the user to send daily motivational tips to the patient (by storing them in the database and providing a daily tips page for the patient to view, etc.).

3.	If the user is a **patient**:
- Allow the user to create and send an emergency alert to first responders (by storing this in a separate collection)
- Allow the user to run motivational video or games that encourage their physical exercises at home.
- Allow the user to enter daily information as specified by the doctor/nurse practitioner (for example *pulse rate, blood pressure, weight, temperature, respiratory rate*).
- Allow the user to use a checklist of common signs and symptoms, to generate a list of possible medical conditions and advice on when to consult a healthcare provider.

Use MongoDB for storing the information. 

Apply MVC and responsive web design principles. Use CSS to create a nice look and feel of your app. Display the logo for the application, other images, game objects, etc.
